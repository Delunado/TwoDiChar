# TwoDiChar
A Unity early prototype for a 2D platformer shooter

You can try the prototipe here from your browser: [BROWSER VERSION](https://delunado.itch.io/two-di-char)  or  download it for Windows: [WINDOWS VERSION](https://github.com/Delunado/TwoDiChar/raw/main/Executables/ExecutableWindows.zip) 

**Important:** the input is handled by the plugin Rewired (which is not included in the assets). You can try the project using the build or the web version, but if you download the source and try to use it in Unity, you'll have to include the Rewired plugin to the project in order to compile and play it.
